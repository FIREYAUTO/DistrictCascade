Strength is a stat that gives you more **Wall-Climbs** and **Wall-Runs**.

The maximum strength level that gives you anything is `3`.

To gain strength, you must purchase the `Weight Pack` left arm gear from the **Gear Shop in D1**. The Weight Pack is the cheapest gear, with a price of {price:{cr}:20}.

StrengthXP += MoveStrengthXP * floor(clamp(ComboLevel/3,1,3))
```
The following mechanics will give you Strength XP:
^ Vaulting
^ Leaping
