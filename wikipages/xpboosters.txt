XP Boosters are usable items that appear in their own category in your inventory.

Using an XP Booster will give you a XP Boost of the specified multiplier for the specified amount of time.

You cannot stack the effects of an XP Booster, as it will ask you if you would like to override one that's already in use.

XP Boosters boost the XP gain of the following:
^ {{mechanics:Moves}}
^ {{generators:Generators}}
^ {{lostobjects:Lost Objects}}
^ {{timetrials:Time-Trials}}
^ {{deliveries:Deliveries}}
^ {{supplydrops:Supply Drops}}
