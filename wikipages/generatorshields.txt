Generator Shields are used to apply a shield to all of your {{generators:claimed generators}} at once.

When your generator has a shield active, it cannot be claimed for the amount of time the shield you used said.

Before you use a generator shield, make sure that it has been 5 minutes since you claimed your generator, so you maximize the time you get with the shield (Please see {{generators:Claimable Generators}} to understand why).
