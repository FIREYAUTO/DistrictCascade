{sv:DM} District Multiplier
Districts are pre-defined areas of the city, each with its own unique style that sets it apart from the other districts. Each district has its own color and name, as well as a {v:DM}.

There are 20 districts in total, and currently only D13 and below are completed.

Districts are able to have their own forced {{weather:weather}}, and there is a setting that allows you to toggle this.

At night, a random district is selected, and its {v:DM} will increase by +0.5x.

## {v:DM}s
{v:DM}s will increase the amount of XP you get from game mechanics. The highest {v:DM} is 3x, which is in **D8, Neon**. 

## RDM
RDM stands for "Recent District Multiplier". It is calculated based on how many districts you enter while alive, over the course of 3 minutes.
RDM Calculation:
```
max(NumberOfDistrictsEntered - 2, 0) / 5
```

## District Layout
Each district boundary is broken up into units. 1 unit is 1024x1024 studs. Using this, you can calculate the total size of the map.
ex: D1 is 2x2 units (4 units total)
