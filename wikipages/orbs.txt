Orbs are items that appear in the `Junk` inventory category. Although, the category they are in is far from what they are.

Orbs are able to be used at the {{altar:altar}}.

## Glitch Orb
The glitch orb is a special orb that requires you to max out your {{glitch:glitch}} stat.
Using this orb at the altar will give you a {{perks:perk}} of +0.15x move XP.
