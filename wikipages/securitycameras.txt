Security cameras are props that are located in areas claimed by the CRA. With the right settings enabled, nearby security cameras will look towards you. 

Staring directly at the camera of this prop will initiate a state that will allow you to get the security camera related badges. If you were to look away for any amount of time, it will reset the timer.
