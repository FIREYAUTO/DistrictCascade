Weather is dependant on the clouds, and may also be forced depending on the given district, as stated in {{districts:Districts}}.

## Clear
| Clear weather is the default weather

## Rain
| Rainy weather happens when the following conditions are met:
```
CloudCover >= 0.85
CloudDensity >= 0.2
```
*Rainy weather has a check index of 2*
^ Rainy weather will change the skybox and atmopshere

## Snow
| Snowy weather happens when the following conditions are met:
```
CloudCover >= 0.85
CloudDensity >= 0.3
CloudColor >= 0.75 (Closer to white)
```
*Snowy weather has a check index of 1*
^ Snowy weather will add a layer of snow on top of all loaded buildings
^ Snowy weather will change the skybox and atmopshere

## Thunder
| Thunder weather on the other hand is different from all the other types of weather
Thunder is computed on the server, and can only happen while it's raining. Here is a list of conditions to determine if thunder should happen or not:
```
CloudCover >= 0.85
CloudDensity >= 0.3
CloudColor < 0.7 (More grayish)
```
Thunder is **NOT** its own type of weather, it is just an event that happens on the server to play thunder sounds.
