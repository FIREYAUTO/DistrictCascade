The inventory UI consists of a list of categories, each category containing specific items.

Each inventory category has its own action buttons. Because of this, if a new item were to be made with a specific action that requires a button, a new inventory category would have to be made.

Clicking on items in your inventory would open a bigger ui element on the right, containing more information about the item.
