Deliveries are started by interacting with a delivery post. Deliveries will have the player deliver a package to a set location, and will reward the player with {crl} and XP. Deliveries can only be started 5 minutes after completing the last one.

## Delivery XP Formula
```
M = XPBoostMultiplier
if OwnsVIP then
	M += 0.5
end
if IsWeekend then
	M += 0.25
end
if IsPremiumUser then
	M += 0.25
end
XP = floor(Distance*(max(1,Level/25)+M))
```

## Delivery Post Locations:
```
D1, D5, D8, D10
```
