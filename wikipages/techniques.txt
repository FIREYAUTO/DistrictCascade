## List of Techniques
### Basic Techniques

^ Catpass Springboard

### Dashes

^ Wall-Dash
| Wall-Dash is a combination of the following moves (in-order) in quick succession: `Wall-Boost -> Wall-Kick`
| Coiling while doing this technique will also increase the output velocity of it.

^ Wall-Push Dash
| If you **wall-push** while above the ground, you will be given downwards velocity, while still having the original horizontal velocity of the wall-push. After this, you'd slide to keep the momentum.

### Drop-Dashes

^ Coiled Double Wall-Boost Drop-Dash
| Jumping off the edge of something while coiling, and performing two **coiled wall-boost** mechanics, then vaulting.

^ Dropdown Wall-Kick Dash
| Performing a **dropdown** and then **wall-kicking** and **vaulting** when possible.

^ Dropdown Wall-Kick Wall-Boost Dash
| Performing the **Dropdown Wall-Kick Dash** technique but you **wall-boost** after the **dropdown wall-kick**.
| This can be chained with more **wall-boosts** and/or **wall-run-kicks**.
