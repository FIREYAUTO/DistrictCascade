Claimable Generators are interactable objects that will give you XP every 5 minutes. You can have a maximum of `2` claimed generators at once.

To claim a generator, you have to answer a simple mathematics question. The question is formatted like this:
```
([0-9]<+-*>[0-9])<+-*>([0-9]<+-*>[0-9])
```
That formatting forces the answer to always be an integer

When you claim a generator, there is a 5 minute period where nobody else can claim your generator, guaranteeing you 1 XP reward. You can use a {{generatorshields:generator shield}} to protect your generator.

There is 1 generator in every completed {{districts::district}}.

## XP Formula
```
GeneratorXP = 1000 --This is the default, currently all generators use this number
PRatio = min(Players,MaxPlayers)/MinPlayers
XP = GeneratorXP * PRatio
M = XPBoostMultiplier
if OwnsVIP then
	M += 0.5
end
if IsWeekend then
	M += 0.25
end
if IsPremiumUser then
	M += 0.25
end
XP *= max(Level/70,1)+M
if DistanceFromGenerator <= 300 then
	XP *= (DistanceFromGenerator/300)
	if DistanceFromGenerator < 100 then
		XP = 0
	end
end
```
