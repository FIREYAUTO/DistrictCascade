Accelerator is a high-level {{armgears:arm gear}} that allows you to achieve high speeds quickly.

Accelerator requires you to charge up the gear in order to use it, and you can only charge the gear while in the air.

Releasing your Arm Gear Keybind will dash you towards the direction of your camera for a specific amount of time and with a specific amount of power.

Accelerator will accelerate you towards the direction you are looking as well, unless you are turning too much while the gear is in use.

# Notes
Accelerator is by far one of the best {{armgears:arm gears}} in the entire game
