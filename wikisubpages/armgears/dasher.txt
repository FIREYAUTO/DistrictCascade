Dasher is a high-level {{armgears::arm gear}} that allows you to achieve high speeds quickly.

Dasher requires you to charge up the gear in order to use it, and you can only charge the gear while in the air.

Releasing your Arm Gear Keybind will dash you towards the direction of your camera for a specific amount of time and with a specific amount of power.
