# Welcome!
Youre currently looking at the github project page for the District Cascade wiki (hopefully you know that by now).

If you know what you are doing and want to help, please reach out using our [Official Discord Server](https://discord.gg/Gf4THCqraJ), because this page isnt checked all that often.

# Creating pages
The page preprocessing, written purely in js, is similar to `Markdown`/`.md` syntax, more evidently inspired by Discord's markup, except most it relies on wrappers or containers (ex: *italics* **bold**) instead of using per-line declaration (like a single `#` for Headings).

It has been made this way to make creating pages less frustrating, as this game updates quite often and there is only one dev to handle all this.

Remember that the files then have to be added to `~/scripts/files.json`. You may set different names for the nav-list item and the page.

Note: FIREYAUTO is the only dev for this game. It is purely a passion project, and he may not always remain open to pages made by bob or his niece or nephew. We're still greatful for any contributions
